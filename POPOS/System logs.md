<h1> Matlab guidelines </h1>
for allowing package add-ons in MATLAB:
sudo chmod -R o+rw /usr/local/MATLAB/R2022b 

Want: install additional package 
Must: install from installer, does not clean-install matlab as long as destination folder is same as before. 


#todo: photoshop is broken after league install
