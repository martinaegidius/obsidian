Dear Dimitrios,

As you know, I am part of your Bachelor's group, and am writing the EyeFormer-project. 
As I mentioned in an earlier mail, I am an SPS-student, and therefore have been granted an academic support teacher. 

We just had a meeting, and he came with some great points on the overall scope of the project-plan, which I think would be beneficial to discuss together. Do you have any time in the next week where you would be available to discuss this in person? 

Best Regards,
Martin
