Per-residue confusion matrix: 
- [x] Implemented
- [x] we get an error, as probably some proteins are predicted as type invalid in the test-set 


Implemented confusion matrix for test-set, but we also want it for train and val 
- [x] Fixed by adding category invalid  

Additional performance metrics to implement
- [x] AUC
- [x] ROC
- [ ] AUPRC 
- [x] ROC
