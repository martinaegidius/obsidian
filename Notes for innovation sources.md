Summary: 
Proposed processes, methods and hardships related to innovation in the health-sector

- Important to understand the problem you are trying to solve before coming up with solution 
- User-driven innovation is proposed as best paradigm for health-sector (many stakeholders, high level of complexity)
	- User-based: based on key stakeholders needs and pains
	- Increases importance of interviewing all key stakeholders
	- It is a good idea to be an onlooker when using the product/service which we are trying to innovate (ie. follow nurses for a day, etc.)
		- Necessary due to stakeholders having biased memory

Concrete cases of user-driven innovation highlighted: 
- Future mobile IT-device for healthcare-professionals
	- Using rapid prototyping while conducting 6 observations of healthcare professionals and video-interviews with 10 different types of hospital wards. One large seminar with 30 participants from 10 wards, private companies and 5 research-institutions -> designing solutions at the seminar together with HC professionals
	- Result: form- and function-specifications for a future mobile IT-solution was formalized (ie. what do we need, how do we need it?)
- The citizen-near hospital 
	- Development of telebased solutions for ressource-strong patient-groups. 
	- Collaboration between a hospital, a patient-organization and two IT-companies 
	- Problem: What treatment do danish patients want, and how do patients want to cooperate with the hospital? How do we ensure that future patients get all relevant information and treatment at the correct time and place? 
	- Process: used foto-diaries and workshops with 50 patients and 30 HCP (nurses, doctors, etc.), where HCP were asked to draw, explain and take photos of their needs for IT-solutions in ambulant treatments. 
	- Result: three system-prototypes which give patients: 
		- a visual overview of own treatment-plan, 
		- information-updates,
		- possibility to order/cancel ambulant appointments online,
		- Read results of lab-tests 
		- Platform for home-consultation using webcam

Section 2: 
Innovative patient involvement on thorax-surgical department
- Goal: develop a toolbox for increasing patient-involvement by identifying key topics defined by patients 
	- Give HCP-staff a toolbox for implementing and innovating patient-topics themselves (employee-driven innovation) -> better solutions for patients, and proven to increase job-satisfaction, reduce sick-leave and increase patientsatisfaction if done right 
	- Method: training hospital-staff in the framework
		- Dynamic model: goals are iterated over throughout the process to accomodate HCP schedules and management requests 
		- Phases: 
			- 1/2: baseline-measurements and project initiation
			- 3: staff training. 3 workshops conducted by extern consultant
				- Workshop, 3 hours: concrete project process and goal, attain common understanding and basic introduction to innovation process
				- Workshop, 3 hours: how to use diaries and interview patients 
				- Workshop for bosses: learning how to manage innovation 
			- 4: gathering patient-interviews 
				- HCP staff asked patients for photo-diaries
				- Key points: many HCP-employees were surprised and touched by their findings. Attained many new angles to patient-experience
				- Different ressources allocated for the two departments - ie. dynamic implementation
				- Big changes in patient-experience when saying: "get better soon" vs. "good luck"
			- 5: HCP staff was trained in order to be able to make their own innovation-workshops for colleagues. 
				- Followingly conducted workshops were used for idea-generation and prototyping based on patient-data 
				- Staff was surprised by: 
					- how quickly they could implement ideas into practice
					- it being a fun activity
			- Phase 6-8: 
				- Keep working with the framework (further workshops, data-gathering, etc)
				- Together present new ideas, choose best ones
				- Implement new ideas
Section 3: ideas from section 2 are tested 
- Big focus on including relatives' perception as well
- Rest not so interesting for us, I think

Section 4: different methodological tools for gathering patient-experience data
- Text-book diaries -> focus-group interviews
- Photodiaries -> deep interview
- Both approaches are deemed very valuable for HPC as they get a direct 


<h1> How to get more nurses </h1>
https://dsr.dk/politik-og-nyheder/det-mener-dsr/loes-manglen-paa-sygeplejersker
DSR: danish nurse union
DSR analysis 2001: 
- 5000 unoccupied nurse-positions
- Trends show it will become worse without action

DSR's 12 reccomendations w/ Max's estimated importance-score for our project, 5 high
1. Increase salaries: 0
2. Allocate more time for quality of service and professionalism for nurses: 4 
3. Create possibilities for work-time scheduling which respects professionalism, voluntariness and private-life (ie. make a scheduling-scheme which is GOOD): 3
4. Make it attractive and feasible to work fulltime: 0 
5. Spend nurse- and other HCP time in a meaningfull manner: 4 (if we are able to optimize the boring stuff somehow -> more time for cool stuff)
6. Increase nursing professional leadership and make sure that the leaders dont leave the field: 3 (if we are able to somehow create a better working-atmosphere)
7. KEEP experienced nurses in the field: 5 (should be possible if we somehow are able to ease their workload OR increase job-satisfaction by other means, e.g. employee-driven innovation)
8. Ensure fitting competance for future needs: 0 (i feel like this is out of our scope)
9. Ease the load on the health-care sector by reducing bureaucracy: 4 (if we are able to make a "smart" way of maintaining same level of bureaucracy but with less effort, e.g. good IT-solution)
10. Educate more nurses: 2 (should be a trickle-down effect if we manage to increase job-satisfaction)
11. Introduction course and full-time employment of all NEW nurses: 0 (I think this is more policial / educative)
12. Ensure recruitment of ALL educated nurses: 4 (again, should be possible if we manage to increase job-satisfaction)

Key-numbers: 
- 82% of nurses experience lowering of patient-security due to the lack of nurses
- 75% of nurses spend time doing non-nursing tasks. On average ~40 minutes of the working-day is spent doing this, and most often the tasks are related to <b>cleaning up and disposing of garbage</b> 
- Communal nurses spend 1154400 hours annually on contacting the General Physician of the patient in relation to the treatment (mainly related to prescription-drugs, vaccinations, etc.). A large proportion of this is in the group of chronic patients, where the nurse tries to contact GP in order to change dosage of prescriptions or make the GP renew existing prescriptions
- 47% of executive nurses (management) feel stressed, mainly due to the work they are doing. (Maybe we should think of meditation or something like this as a possible solution?)

<h1> In what departments are the issues the largest </h1>
https://dsr.dk/sites/default/files/50/notat_sygeplejerskemangel_paa_udvalgte_specialer_2022_.pdf
Only stratified as medical / intensive departments of hospitals. The issues are most prominent in medical departments, so I think we should not focus on acute hospital sections 

<h1> Time spent on non-nurse tasks </h1> 
https://dsr.dk/sites/default/files/50/notat_ikke-sygeplejefaglige_opgaver_2021.pdf
Key takeaway: A LOT of time is spent on <b>cleaning</b>. This could be an obvious angle of attack

Ordered by percentage (decreasing):
- Cleaning up and disposing trash: 69% of nurses 
- Other cleaning-jobs: 48% of nurses
- Refilling medicine, medical coats, etc.: 44%
- Washing up dishes: 44%
- Restocking hospital depots: 36%
- Non-related phone-calls with patients and patients relatives: 25%
- Transporting patients internally: 17%
- Cleaning beds: 21%

<h1> Other key take-aways from DSR analytics </h1> 
- There is a large issue with <b>bullying</b> among nurses (11% of non-managing nurses have been bullied in the last year, 26% of nurses have observed bullying in the last year and 25% of nurses have had sick-days due to bullying in the last year)
- 8% of recently educated nurses have had sick-leave (short or long) due to psychic stress on the job. The proportion is significantly lower when a satisfying introductory course was provided and/or if lone-responsibility was first granted for tasks when the nurse has been <b>ready</b> for it.
